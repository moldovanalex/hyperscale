# README for Hyperscale

Hyperscale is a project that leverages AWS Amplify, OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo, and Amazon Textract to automate the extraction and analysis of information from uploaded documents. The purpose of this application is to simplify and make more efficient the process of extracting text, and to provide valuable and relevant information from the contents of documents.

The problem addressed by this project is the difficulty of quickly and accurately extracting and analyzing information from documents in various formats such as PDF files, scanned documents, or photographs with text. The manual process of reading and interpreting these documents can be laborious and time-consuming, which is why the development of an application that automates this task is necessary.

The objectives of the Hyperscale project are:

Implementing a solution for text extraction from documents using Amazon Textract, an AWS service specialized in Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This functionality will allow users to upload documents in different formats and obtain the text contained in them in a digital format that is easy to handle and analyze.
Integrating OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo, one of the most advanced artificial intelligence models, to extract and analyze relevant information from the previously obtained text. The GPT 3.5 Turbo model is trained on a wide variety of data and can provide significant results in various areas of interest.
Hyperscale serves to streamline the process of extracting and analyzing information from documents, allowing users to access relevant content quickly and efficiently, and to obtain valuable insights. Using AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, AWS AppSync, Amazon S3, Amazon Cognito, Amazon CloudFormation, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, and Amazon API Gateway, a scalable and secure architecture is created for managing the uploading of documents and the extraction of information from them.

This project presents an innovative approach to the automatic management and analysis of documents, using advanced technologies such as AWS Amplify, OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo, and Amazon Textract. Hyperscale has the potential to provide efficient solutions in various fields, such as contract analysis, invoice processing, or extraction of information from legal documents.

*Note*
Please be aware that some configurations were made directly through the AWS Console. This includes setting environment variables for certain functions and establishing S3 triggers.
