# Hyperscale

Hyperscale is a powerful project that combines AWS Amplify, OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo, Amazon Textract, and other AWS services to automate the extraction and analysis of information from uploaded documents. The primary goal of this application is to simplify and optimize the process of extracting text and providing valuable insights from the content of documents.

## Problem Addressed

The challenge tackled by this project is the cumbersome and error-prone task of manually extracting and analyzing information from documents in various formats like PDF files, scanned documents, or images with text. The manual process of reading and interpreting these documents can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, the development of an application that automates this process is essential.

## Features

- Seamless integration with AWS services for efficient document processing.
- Utilization of OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo for advanced language processing.
- Automated extraction and analysis of text from diverse document formats.
- Scalable architecture for handling large volumes of documents.

## Note

Please be aware that certain configurations were set directly through the AWS Console, including environment variables for specific functions and S3 triggers.

## Project Scope

This project was initially developed as my final project for my Bachelor's Degree. I built it from the ground up over four days, dedicating two days to the frontend and two days to the backend. While the project has provided valuable results in a short timeframe, there is room for code quality improvement due to the limited development time.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/moldovanalex/hyperscale.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your AWS Amplify configuration: `amplify configure`
4. Deploy the application: `amplify push`

## Folder Structure
